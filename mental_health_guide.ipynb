Especially in the midst of a global pandemic, this last year has been really hard for everyone and you have had your own struggles. First thing i'd suggest is getting the sleep you need or it will impact how you think and feel . I'd also suggest you to look at your life and find out what is going well in your life and what you can be grateful for . I believe everyone has something in their life to be grateful for. You can figure it out with some help. I would suggest you to start a writing journal, it is really going to help you with understanding your own emotions.\n",
